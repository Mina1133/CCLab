                <p>Puffins don’t live in houses or stay in one place. They wander, following the breeze, the stars, or
                    just whatever makes their hearts flutter. But they’re never truly alone—because all puffins are

                Before spring existed, the world was quiet and gray. The flowers were too shy to bloom, and the sun
                forgot how to smile.

                One day, two curious little worms met while chasing the same falling star. When they bumped into each
                other, they tumbled into a swirl of laughter and stardust. In that moment, they realized they were two
                halves of one whole.The puffin wiggled its way across the land, giggling and dancing, and wherever it
                stepped, flowers sprouted in surprise. Birds started to sing, breezes warmed, and the world lit up with
                color.

                Ever since, puffins have wandered the globe, following their hearts and waking spring wherever they go.
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Puffins are born from unity, the beautiful result of two halves finally finding
                    each other and becoming whole. They are led by their hearts, guided by emotion and instinct, which
                    fills their journey with joy and meaning. As adults, they become symbols of hope and good fortune.
                    Wherever they walk, flowers bloom in their footsteps, and they migrate across the world, bringing
                    spring to every place they touch.
